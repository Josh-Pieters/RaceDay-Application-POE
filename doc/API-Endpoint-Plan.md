### Notes
- All authenticated routes expect an `Authorization: Bearer <token>` header containing the JWT issued at login.
- Role checks are enforced server-side via `[Authorize(Roles = "...")]` in Part 2; ownership checks (e.g. "only the owning Organiser") are enforced in the service layer by comparing the token's user id to the resource's OrganiserID/ParticipantID.
- Standard error responses (400/401/403/404/409) follow a consistent JSON error shape: `{ "message": "..." }`.
